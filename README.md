# F1 Race Finishing Position Prediction

This project aims to predict the finishing positions of drivers in Formula 1 races using machine learning models trained on historical and current season data.

## Problem

Predicting F1 race outcomes is challenging due to numerous influencing factors. This project tackles this problem by building predictive models.

## Goal

To develop and compare machine learning models for predicting F1 race finishing orders, specifically focusing on a target race (e.g., 2025 Saudi Arabian GP).

## Methodology

1.  **Data Collection:** Utilized the `fastf1` library to gather historical F1 race data (2018-2024) and data from the current season (2025) before the target race.

2.  **Feature Engineering:** Created features such as Driver and Constructor Points Indices (normalized championship standings) and incorporated predefined Driver Characteristics alongside raw data like Qualifying Time and Grid Position.

3.  **Modeling:** Implemented and compared three machine learning models:
    * Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)
    * Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
    * LambdaMART (LightGBM Ranker) - a model specifically for ranking.

4.  **Training & Evaluation:** Models were trained on historical data and evaluated on a test set using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression models and Mean NDCG@20 for the ranking model. Predictions were then made for the target race.

## Key Results

* All models identified **Grid Position** as the most significant predictor of finishing position.

* Championship standings (Points Indices) and Qualifying Time were also found to be important features.

* The Gradient Boosting Regressor showed the lowest MAE on the test set for predicting exact positions.

* The LambdaMART model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the relative finishing order (ranking).

* Predicted finishing orders for the target race (2025 Saudi Arabian GP) were generated by each model.

## Technologies Used

* Python

* `fastf1`

* `pandas`

* `numpy`

* `scikit-learn`

* `lightgbm`

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (`fastf1`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `lightgbm`) installed.

2.  Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`project.ipynb`). The notebook contains the code for data collection, preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

3.  Modify the `TARGET_YEAR` and `TARGET_GP_NAME` variables in the notebook to predict different races.
